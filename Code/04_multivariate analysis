# Proportions
prop1 = dca1/total

prop4 = dca4/total

# Percentages
perc1 = prop1*100
perc2 = prop2*100
perc3 = prop3*100
perc4 = prop4*100

# Whole amount of variability (%)
perc1 + perc2

# = 71.03683
# This means:
# The first two axes explain 715 of variability

# The decorana function is purely mathematical. 
# If I want to identify what each axis means, I need to compare it with known site data or ecological knowledge.
